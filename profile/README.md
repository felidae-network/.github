## Welcome to the Felidae Community! 

We are building the future of secure, decentralized identity solutions for Web3. 
Our mission is to develop innovative protocols and applications that ensure privacy, security, and verifiable identity without compromising user anonymity.

> Overview & Key Repositories

The Felidae Protocol is centered on a groundbreaking Web3 identity onboarding and verification process. Using oracles, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), and decentralized identifiers (DIDs), we enable secure and anonymous access to decentralized applications (dApps). Our goal is to ensure that users can authenticate without sacrificing privacy, while allowing seamless interactions in the Web3 ecosystem.

> Felidae Node (Substrate Framework)

This repository contains the core implementation of our consensus protocol for decentralized identity creation and oracle-driven validation. It leverages Proof of Value & Oracle Consensus (PoVoc) to generate decentralized identifiers (DIDs) through a trusted network of oracles, while also managing the reputation of each oracle.

- Consensus mechanism based on Proof of Value & Oracles.
- DID creation using oracle validation.
- Reputation management for oracles to ensure trustworthiness and accuracy.

> Anonymous Login (Halo2 Proof systems)

This repository implements a privacy-focused login system that uses Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to allow users to authenticate anonymously while ensuring their identity and authenticity. With this system, users can log into decentralized applications without revealing any personally identifiable information.

- Anonymous login using ZKP.
- Privacy-preserving authentication process.
- Ensures both anonymity and verifiable authenticity.
